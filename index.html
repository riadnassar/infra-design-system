				<h2> Our Client: Beyond Vision</h2>

			<!-- Name Explanation -->
			<section>
				
				<h2>Behind the Name</h2>

				<p>Given that Beyond Vision makes a platform for AR and VR, I decided I wanted to go with something that invokes a feeling of the Future. So I tried to stick with science concepts. At first, I tried to go with words that have a tactile feel to them, but it was hard to find any other than carbon that would get the same idea across and carbon was already taken. So while looking at Sci-fi artwork, I realized that I should give it a name that has to do with light. Afterall, the Vision is in the company name. On the light spectrum, humans can’t see beyond 2 points. Past these points are Ultraviolet and Infrared. Ultra sounded arrogant and childish, so Infra it is.</p>

				<p>Hopefully the name invokes the idea of Science, the Future, and Innovation. Since Beyond Vision is about creating an AR and VR platform, I want people to feel like they’re on Earth 1000 years in the future. Flying Cars, HUD on your Glasses, Robot Butlers, Cred Sticks, Neon Colored Drinks in Tubes. And I want people to think that Beyond Vision is the one taking them there.</p>
